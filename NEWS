TODOs:

## simplify how weights are computed in known mean/estimated mean cases and maybe bypass blp() function entirely

## enclose all prints/cats in if(!quietly){...}

## fix global binding warnings in R CMD check

## option to parameterize SigmaX and estimate those parameters

## allow target to be a list of named vectors so that we get BLPs for a vector of outcomes simultaneously

## adding cluster-robust SEs (at school level) for the block-by-pattern FE computed at the OLS stage,
## so that the variance due to this term can be incorporated into the MSE estimator for the BLP

## NEED TO DEAL WITH vX_est, right now just estimating all elements of vX without regard to vXest

## need to deal with school stratification and possible additional sum-to-zero constraints
