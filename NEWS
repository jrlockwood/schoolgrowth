TODOs:

## rename muhat when mean_supplied to mu_supplied, and make all mu variable names more sane

## simplify how weights are computed in known mean/estimated mean cases and maybe bypass blp() function entirely

## adding simple equal weighted average by year to what's tracked (NOTE: tricky due to mean changes)

## fix global binding warnings in R CMD check

## allow target to be a list of named vectors so that we get BLPs for a vector
   of outcomes simultaneously (e.g. Dan's idea of requesting the raw block-level
   BLPs for each school) - we should also make sure this information is included
   on dsch 

## adding cluster-robust SEs (at school level) for the block-by-pattern FE computed at the OLS stage,
## so that the variance due to this term can be incorporated into the MSE estimator for the BLP

## need to deal with school stratification and possible additional sum-to-zero
   constraints - or maybe the code should just stay as is, forcing the end-user
   to think about and confront strata directly, rather than having an automatic
   solution implemented that might not do what someone wants
