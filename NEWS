perhaps switch order of nearPD() and expansion from (B-1) to B because the
existing order of operations appears not to be invariant to ordering of blocks,
which boils down to not being invariant to labels.  also consider whether
forcing PSD via spectral decomposition rather than nearPD, either at (B-1) or B
stage, would be invariant. (NOTE: in explorations, switching labels on blocks to
switch order did not impact Rraw and Graw, but did have some effect on G)

add something about variance decomposition diagnostics (comparing estimated and
observed moments), perhaps after adjusting for block*pattern effects

add control option "report_patterns_only" that halts and returns after the
student pattern block of code

allow target to be a list of named vectors so that we get BLPs for a vector of
outcomes simultaneously

generalize the syntax of target to allow importance weights on blocks, like you
might need if defining a multi-year target

create S3 class and associated summary and plot methods
