01/15/2019:
  -changed blp() and schoolgrowth() to do different calculation for weights
  -explicitly defined contrasts to sparse.model.matrix and return estimated mean parameters
  -add check on computations if(control$schoolFE)

01/14/2019:
  -changed how weights were returned so that NULL entries are excluded, so that length of weights
  list matches the number of rows of the adjusted growth matrix

01/11/2019:
  -updated blp() to return weights, and modified schoolgrowth() to track weights and return them
  -changed NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION so that Matrix library is not loaded

01/08/2019:
  -some changes to residual calculations to try to reduce RAM footprint, including using
   Matrix:::sparse.model.matrix to get the fitted values from the two levels of fixed effects

01/04/2019:
  -some fixes so that function will still work, and produce BLP, when the number of cells is
   only 1 or 2.  also changed syntax of rm() after computing variance component estimates

12/12/2018:
  -added option "target_contrast" that gets negative weights, to allow estimation of contrasts

12/5/2018:
  -more checks on input field formats plus coercion to character
  -return "dtab"

12/4/2018:
  -added some variance components and R^2 for model of G
  -added option "schoolFE" to control list; defaults to TRUE; if FALSE we do not use school FE
  -required each year*grade*subject combination to have at least two schools

12/3/2018:
  -relaxed requirement that "target" be final year; prints warning if target does not include
   final year
  -added some more checks while parsing "target"

11/30/2018:
  -fixed RAM-eating unique() operation
  -changed "target" to be a named vector
  -added some elements to return
  -added ... argument that gets passed to nearPD()
  -added arguments SigmaX, SigmaU, N that can be used to bypass variance component calculation

  -initial commit

#############################################

-more validity checks on control parameters and/or input data

-option to parameterize SigmaX and estimate those parameters

-maybe allow target to be a list of named vectors so that we get BLPs for a vector of outcomes simultaneously

-fix global binding warnings in R CMD check
