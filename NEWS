TODOs:

## fix global binding warnings in R CMD check

## allow target to be a list of named vectors so that we get BLPs for a vector
   of outcomes simultaneously (e.g. Dan's idea of requesting the raw block-level
   BLPs for each school) - we should also make sure this information is included
   on dsch

## add cluster-robust SEs (at school level) for the block-by-pattern FE computed
   at the OLS stage, so that the variance due to this term can be incorporated
   into the MSE estimator for the BLP

## allow user-supplied number of jackknife replications




## HELP FILE NOTES

## note that code forces the end-user to think about and confront
   strata directly, rather than having an automatic solution implemented that
   might not do what someone wants.  the code will not run without
   connectedness.

## note that jackknife relies on random partitioning of schools into batches,
   and for replicability, user will have to set.seed() outside the function
