revised matrix adjustment procedures, arguments and help file

add something about variance decomposition diagnostics (comparing estimated and
observed moments), perhaps after adjusting for block*pattern effects

allow target to be a list of named vectors so that we get BLPs for a vector of
outcomes simultaneously

generalize the syntax of target to allow importance weights on blocks, like you
might need if defining a multi-year target

create S3 class and associated summary and plot methods
