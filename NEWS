TODOs:

## maybe remove the big GLS computation of school FE and split things out by
   school, to make it closer to how we might do things when we jackknife

## maybe move computation of lambda and related information
   to earlier in the code

## think about second-order corrected variance estimator of GLS estimator of
   school fixed effect, to see if we can remove downward bias in estimated
   sampling variance of estimated school FE.  probably do the same thing for the
   second-order corrected MSE estimator of EBLP
   **maybe approximate with jackknifing schools for estimating G

## fix behavior of assigning aggregate growth with a contrast where ncontrast =
   0.  i think if school had data in target, but we were computing a contrast,
   it would either crash or result in nonsense.  with contrast, there needs to
   be data in both the target and target_contrast to get an estimate

## fix global binding warnings in R CMD check

## allow target to be a list of named vectors so that we get BLPs for a vector
   of outcomes simultaneously (e.g. Dan's idea of requesting the raw block-level
   BLPs for each school) - we should also make sure this information is included
   on dsch

## add cluster-robust SEs (at school level) for the block-by-pattern FE computed
   at the OLS stage, so that the variance due to this term can be incorporated
   into the MSE estimator for the BLP

## for help file: note that code forces the end-user to think about and confront
   strata directly, rather than having an automatic solution implemented that
   might not do what someone wants.  the code will not run without
   connectedness.
