TODOs:

## rename muhat when mean_supplied to mu_supplied, and make all mu variable names more sane

## change BLP calculation so that all schools get BLP even if they don't have
## data in the target blocks, in which case they just get what's implied by the
## FE structure.  Need to make sure that MSE calculation is correct in that case.

## simplify how weights are computed in known mean/estimated mean cases and
   maybe bypass blp() function entirely

## fix global binding warnings in R CMD check

## allow target to be a list of named vectors so that we get BLPs for a vector
   of outcomes simultaneously (e.g. Dan's idea of requesting the raw block-level
   BLPs for each school) - we should also make sure this information is included
   on dsch 

## add cluster-robust SEs (at school level) for the block-by-pattern FE computed
## at the OLS stage, so that the variance due to this term can be incorporated
## into the MSE estimator for the BLP

## for help file: note that code forces the end-user to think about and confront
## strata directly, rather than having an automatic solution implemented that
## might not do what someone wants.  the code will not run without connectedness.
