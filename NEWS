## 10/28/2021: bugfix:
update maxit to 100,000 in the matrix-utils.R file for the Radj function:
.res <- nearPD2(Madj, fix0s=TRUE, do2eigen=FALSE, eig.tol=eig.tol, conv.tol=1e-11, maxit=100000_)

allow target to be a list of named vectors so that we get BLPs for a vector of
outcomes simultaneously

generalize the syntax of target to allow importance weights on blocks, like you
might need if defining a multi-year target

add something about variance decomposition diagnostics (comparing estimated and
observed moments), perhaps after adjusting for block*pattern effects

create S3 class and associated summary and plot methods
